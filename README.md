# weather-app-vanilla-js

## What is this?
This is a simple weather app in Vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML without the use of any libraries. I have used the Open Weather Map API to make calls to a restful api to return the current weather data for entered city. This uses the modern JavaScript Fetch API.
